      question: "What is CSRD compliance and why is it important?",
      answer:
        "The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) is an EU regulation requiring companies to report on their environmental and social impact. It's important because it promotes transparency, helps investors make informed decisions, and encourages companies to adopt sustainable practices. Non-compliance can result in significant penalties and reputational damage.",

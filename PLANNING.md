# PLANNING.md

## Vision

Raylow is a compliance assistant for SMEs in Europe.
The platform helps companies:

- **Discover** which regulations apply to them.
- **Comply** by filling forms, generating reports, and tracking progress.
- **Collaborate** across teams with invites, messaging, and role-based access.
- **Learn** through flashcards, analytics, and AI-powered chat.
- **Stay informed** via newsletters and real-time notifications of new or changing regulations.

Goal: make regulatory compliance **accessible, actionable, and continuous** for SMEs to make reporting an easier, more efficient, cost-effective method and also for SMEs that lack dedicated compliance staff.

## Current Implementation Status (2025-01-06)

âœ… **Completed**:
- Landing page with authentication (email/password + Google OAuth)
- Basic onboarding flow with user and company registration  
- Real Supabase database integration (companies and users tables)
- Frontend-backend communication with proper CORS configuration
- Redux Toolkit state management for authentication and onboarding
- Environment variable consolidation across root, frontend, and backend

ðŸ”„ **Next Focus**: Dashboard and analytics (Milestone 2)

## Architecture

### Frontend

- **React (Vite)**.
- Feature-first folder structure under `/src/features/`.
- Component-driven UI with Javascript.
- Communicates with Supabase (for auth and DB) and Node.js backend API.

### Backend

- **Node.js (Javascript)** with REST API.
- Acts as middleware between frontend and Supabase for:

  - Role validation and RLS policies.
  - Secure functions (report generation, newsletter jobs).
  - Background jobs (scheduled tasks).

### Database

- **Supabase (Postgres)** with:

  - Tables for companies, users, regulations, forms, reports, messaging, chat.
  - Row-Level Security (RLS) enforcing company isolation.
  - Functions for discovery (`apply_eligibility_recommendations`).
  - Views for computed progress.

- Migrations tracked under `/supabase/migrations`.

### Data flows

- User login â†’ Supabase Auth â†’ `users` table profile.
- Company creation â†’ `companies` + admin `users`.
- Regulation discovery â†’ `eligibility_*` tables â†’ recommendations â†’ `company_regulations`.
- Form filling â†’ `user_responses` â†’ progress view.
- Report submission â†’ `reports`.
- Messaging/chat â†’ `chat_sessions`, `chat_messages`, `company_messages`.
- Analytics â†’ query `v_company_regulation_progress` and report stats.

### Integrations

- Email delivery (invites, newsletters, alerts).
- Storage for report exports (Supabase storage or S3).
- RAG knowledge base for AI chat.
